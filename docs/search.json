So here it is - blog 2.0.\nMainly what you’ll get here is:\n\nInsights from data\nBuilding online software in public\nExperiences with tools and workflows\nEscapades in husbandary (being a husband not cultivating plants/animals), fatherhood, sport/fitness and food.\n\nI’ve always been fond of authors that try to make their work reproducible and I will attempt that too for the data/software stuff, time permitting.\nThat’s enough for a welcome, now onto the first post.\n\n\n\nby Shubham Dhage"
