That was me on lap 4 of 8, sodden, in a stinking tent - it marked my last happy lap!"

    "text": "marko swift\n\n\nThis blog post is here by no popular demand, but I think this data deserves the same recognition as Miss Swift IMO.\nSo what is ERA5?\nERA5 is short for ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) and is a climate data product from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). OK, enough acronyms for now.\nThe main WOW factor that ERA5 has over other datasets is it’s incredible spatial and temporal resolution. The data begins 4 months into World War 2 (January 1940) and goes to present day, for every hour, for every 31km section of land and sea across the globe.\nIn terms of the climate data there is a wide selection at a single atmospheric level and a few at multi-level (e.g. pressure, temperature). Popular single level data includes:\n\n10m u-component of wind (velocity in the East direction)\n10m v-component of wind (velocity in the North direction)\nMean wave period\nSignificant height of combined wind waves and swell\n2m temperature\nTotal precipitation\n\nWhat would you want to do with this data?\nThere are so many potential applications of this data from renewable energy project development (link) to public health.\ndata (from GCP/AWS buckets, the Climate Data Store - Copernicus API etc) and how to deal with the different formats (NetCDF, zarr etc)."
