    "text": "So what is ERA5?\nERA5 is short for ECMWF Reanalysis v5 and is a climate data product from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). OK, enough acronyms for now.\nThe main WOW factor that ERA5 has over other datasets is it’s incredible spatial and temporal resolution. The data begins 4 months into World War 2 (January 1940) and goes to present day, for every hour, for every 31km section of land and sea across the globe.\nIn terms of the climate data there is a wide selection at a single atmospheric level and a few at multi-level (e.g. pressure, temperature). Popular single level data includes:\n\n10m u-component of wind (velocity in the East direction)\n10m v-component of wind (velocity in the North direction)\nMean wave period\nSignificant height of combined wind waves and swell\n2m temperature\nTotal precipitation"

If you need less than a year of any variable go for CDS API; if you need more than a year and any variable email for a bulk download; if you need over a year for a selection of variables then you might be able to use data on AWS/GCP. The Google Earth Engine option can do both, but comes at a high cost for commercial applications; there’s also a good python-based tutorial here.\n\nCDS API\nThe standard way to interact with ERA5 data and one that does a great job for smaller datasets (most likely less than a year).\n\nNow copy and paste that into a python script.\n\nNow get credentials from CDS and add them as an environmental variable.\n\n\nFormats\n\nNetCDF\nZarr"
