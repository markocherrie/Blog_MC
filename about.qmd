Hi I'm Mark - a scientist turned full stack engineer, living in Edinburgh, Scotland.

This blog will feature: Insights from data, Building software in public, Experiences with tools and workflows and Escapades in husbandary (being a husband not cultivating plants/animals), fatherhood, sport/fitness and food. 

The photo is from this years Loch Ness 24, a 24 hour run that I completed with a few friends. That was me on lap 4 of 8, sodden, in a stinking tent - it marked my last happy lap!
