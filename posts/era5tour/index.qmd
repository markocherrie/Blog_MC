This blog post is here by no popular demand, but I think this data deserves the same recognition as Miss Swift IMO. 

## So what is ERA5? 

ERA5 is short for ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) and is a climate data product from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). OK, enough acronyms for now.

The main **WOW** factor that ERA5 has over other datasets is it's incredible spatial and temporal resolution. The data begins 4 months into World War 2 (January 1940) and goes to present day, for every **hour**, for every 31km section of land and sea across the **globe**. 

In terms of the climate data there is a wide selection at a single atmospheric level and a few at multi-level (e.g. pressure, temperature). Popular single level data includes:

* 10m u-component of wind (velocity in the East direction)
* 10m v-component of wind (velocity in the North direction)
* Mean wave period
* Significant height of combined wind waves and swell
* 2m temperature
* Total precipitation

### What would you want to do with this data? 

There are so many potential applications of this data from renewable energy project development (link) to [public health](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/met.2122). 

## How do you access this data?

* GCP/AWS buckets
* Climate Data Store - Copernicus API etc) 


### Formats 

* NetCDF
* Zarr



## Why is this a timely blog post?

This instance of the CDS will be decommissioned on 26 September 2024 and will no longer be accessible from this date onwards. Please check our informative page to migrate to CDS-Beta now
