        "\n",
        "ERA5 is short for ECMWF Reanalysis v5 and is a climate data product from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). OK, enough acronyms for now.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main **WOW** factor that ERA5 has over other datasets is it's incredible spatial and temporal resolution. The data begins 4 months into World War 2 (January 1940) and goes to present day, for every **hour**, for every 31km section of land and sea across the **globe**. \n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of the climate data there is a wide selection at a single atmospheric level and a few at multi-level (e.g. pressure, temperature). Popular single level data includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "* 10m u-component of wind (velocity in the East direction)\n",
        "* 10m v-component of wind (velocity in the North direction)\n",
        "* Mean wave period\n",
        "* Significant height of combined wind waves and swell\n",
        "* 2m temperature\n",
        "* Total precipitation\n",
        "\n",
        "## What can you do with this data? \n",
        "\n",
        "There are so many potential applications of this data from weather impacts on renewable energy project development (link) and [public health](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/met.2122), alongside the more standard meterological questions of \n",

        "## How do you access this data?\n",
        "\n",
        "There are three main ways to access the data that I know about:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Climate Data Store - Copernicus API   (CDS API)\n",
        "* S3 storage (GCP/AWS)\n",
        "* Google Earth Engine (GEE) \n",
        "\n",
        "![Figure 1: Sources of era5 data](sources.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "Deciding on which source you use depends on how much data you need and what variables you need. If you need less than a year of any variable go for CDS API; if you need more than a year and any variable email for a bulk download; if you need over a year for a selection of variables then you might be able to use data on AWS/GCP. The Google Earth Engine option can do both, but comes at a high cost for commercial applications; there's also a good python-based tutorial [here](https://github.com/jwagemann/era5_in_gee).  \n",

        "### CDS API\n",
        "\n",
