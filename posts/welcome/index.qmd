I used to blog for years but it slowly tailed off. 

I miss having a place on the internet where I can put down ideas, progress on side projects and general life stuff. So here it is - blog 2.0.

Mainly what you'll get here is:  
 
* Insights from data
* Building software in public
* Experiences with tools and workflows 

I've always been fond of authors that try to make their work reproducible and I will attempt that too for the data/software stuff, time permitting.  

That's enough of a welcome, now onto the first post.
